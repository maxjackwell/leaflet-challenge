# leaflet-challenge
Challenge 15 looks at an API focusing in on Earthquakes around the world. In this session, I decided to look at all of the earthquakes recorded in the last 30 days. I visualized them with the color describing the depth of the Earthquake, and the size of the circle relates to the overall magnitude of the Earthquake. Looking at the HTML, this map lights up like a Christmas tree, especially along fault lines. We could have changed the graphic to only look at certain Magnitudes or even included data to show if Tsunamis occured in response to the EQ. 
I could not have completed this challenge without previous class notes, the AskBCS tutors and the following links:
